# VAMP = Virtual Assistant Maintenance Patch

This is a scriptable one shot coding AI client meant to help fix TODOs and FIXMEs. It is purposely simple and intended for use with VINE and VETO when I get around to publishing those. But it can also be used to script AI edits if you're feeling lucky.

I would use it with vim but I don't suggest using it without some bit of common sense and caution. I will be building better documentation as we go. But you get what you got for now.
